These antivirus detections are based on heuristic analysis and machine learning, which can sometimes cause false positives, especially with executables created using PyInstaller.

üîç Analysis of detections: Bkav Pro - W64.AIDetectMalware ‚Üí AI-based detection, may produce false positives.

DeepInstinct - MALICIOUS ‚Üí Aggressive machine learning-based detection.

Kaspersky - HEUR:HackTool.Python.DDoS.gen ‚Üí Flags Python tools potentially used for DDoS attacks.

SecureAge - Malicious ‚Üí Often flags any unknown executable as malicious.

SentinelOne (Static ML) - Static AI - Suspicious PE ‚Üí Uses static AI analysis, detecting anomalies without running the file.

‚ö†Ô∏è What does this mean for you? If you converted a Python script to .exe using PyInstaller, these detections might be false positives because: ‚úÖ PyInstaller obfuscates the code, making it look suspicious. ‚úÖ The generated file includes a bundled Python interpreter.
